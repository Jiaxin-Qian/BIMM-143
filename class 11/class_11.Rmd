##PDB Statistics

Here we inspect the types of structure in the main database for 3D biomolecular data 

> Q1. determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Also can
you determine what proportion of structures are protein? 

```{r}
#read the file 
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
#calculate
#calculate the percentage for each method 
ans <- stats$Total/sum(stats$Total) * 100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round(ans, 2)
protein <- round(sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total) * 100, 2)
protein


```

>Q2: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many
HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
